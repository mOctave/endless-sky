# Introduction

The [syntax](DataFormat#grammar-specifications) for the definition of a fleet is:

```html
fleet <name>
	government <name>
	names <phrase>
	fighters <phrase>
	cargo <cargo#>
	commodities <commodity>...
	outfitters <outfitter>...
	"cargo settings"
		cargo <cargo#>
		commodities <commodity>...
		outfitters <outfitter>...
	personality <type>...
		<type>...
		confusion <amount#>
	variant [<weight#>]
		<model> [<count#>]
		...
```

# Basic fleet characteristics

```html
fleet <name>
```

The fleet name must be unique. Using this fleet name, this fleet can be spawned by systems or missions.

```html
government <name>
```

The name of the [government](CreatingGovernments) that this fleet is a part of. All ships spawned by this fleet will be a part of this government.

```html
names <phrase>
fighters <phrase>
```

The names of the ships in this fleet, constructed from the given [phrase](CreatingPhrases). If only `names` is listed, then all ships in the fleet will pull their name from that phrase. If `fighters` is also listed, then the fighters and drones in the fleet will pull their names from that phrase, while all other ships will still use the `names` phrase.

```html
cargo <cargo#>
commodities <commodity>...
```

The number of types of commodities that this fleet will carry as cargo and a list of the types of those commodities. If no `cargo` number is given, then the default number of commodity types carried is 3. If no particular `commodities` are listed _and_ no outfitter lists are specified, then the commodities can be of any type. The amount of each commodity will be a random number from 0 to the cargo capacity of the ship.

(Specifying `outfitters` but not `commodities` will prevent fleet ships from carrying commodities. Specifying either both or neither results in a higher chance of carrying commodities.)

```html
outfitters <outfitter>...
```

Ships can also carry outfits as cargo, specified by the [outfitters](CreatingOutfits#sales) listed here. If no particular `outfitters` are listed _and_ no `commodities` are specified, then ships may carry outfits from the outfitters of the system they spawn in and the outfitters of all systems linked directly to the spawn system.

(Specifying `commodities` but not `outfitters` will prevent fleet ships from carrying outfits. Specifying either both or neither results in a higher chance of carrying commodities.)

```html
"cargo settings"
	cargo <cargo#>
	commodities <commodity>...
	outfitters <outfitter>...
```

Beginning in **v. 0.10.1**, the above three keys, `cargo`, `commodities`, and `outfitters`, can also be defined under a `"cargo settings"` node.

```html
personality <type>...
	<type>...
	<type>
	...
	confusion <amount#>
```

The [personalities](ShipPersonalities) that specify how this fleet acts. Personality types can be listed on the same line as the `personality` node in a list separated by spaces, as a list that is a child of `personality`, and/or one type on each line as a child of `personality`, but `confusion` must be listed as a child of `personality` alone on its own line. The default confusion if not listed is 10.

# Variants

```html
variant [<weight#>]
	<model> [<count#>]
	...
```

Variants define what model and number of [ships](CreatingShips) are spawned by this fleet. A number of variants can be listed under a single fleet. When the fleet is spawned, one of these variants will be chosen at random according to their weights. The chance for any single variant to be spawned is `variant weight / sum of all variant weights`. For example, if a variant has a weight of 4 and the sum of all variant weights in the fleet is 20, then that variant has a 4/20 chance of being spawned.

If no weight is given for the variant (or no count for a ship model), then the weight (or count) is 1.
